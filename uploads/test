While both projects involve building HTTP-based services
and have CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations,
the focus and use cases are different. The file sharing
service is more oriented toward handling binary data (files)
and managing ownership through tokens, allowing
users to share and access files without requiring user registration.
